![fire_detection_example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b60472-803e-4bab-b637-71e2dc0a2c8d)

This project detects fire in real-time using **OpenCV** and a webcam. The script processes frames, identifies fire regions based on HSV color filtering, and marks detected fire areas with bounding boxes.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Real-time fire detection  
- Bounding box with coordinates  
- Detects both red and yellow flames  

## 📌 Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)  
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)  

## ▶️ Usage  
Run the script:  
```bash
python fire_detection.py
